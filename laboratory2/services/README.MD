# ROS Services
ROS services can be created as follows :
- Create a folder `srv` inside the folder `<path_package_name>`.
- Create a `srv1.srv` file with the following content :
    ```
    int32 A
    int32 B 
    int32 C
    ---
    int32 sum
    ```
- Modify the file `<path_package_name>/CMakeLists.txt` as follow :
    - in the section **Find catkin macros and libraries** this piece of code must be placed : 
        ```
        find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS roscpp std_msgs message_generation)
        ```
    - in the section **Generate messages in the 'msg' folder** this piece of code must be placed :
        ```
        rossrv show intro_tutorial/srv1
        ```
- To check that all is OK, the following command must be exectuted : `rossrv show <package_name>/<srv_name>` in this case, `rossrv show <package_name>/srv1`. 
If everything was done correctly, the following output will be displayed :
    ```
    int32 A
    int32 B 
    int32 C
    ---
    int32 sum
    ```
Other interesting commands regarding services are :
- `rosservice call <srv_name> [args]` : calling the service with the arguments provided.
- `rosservice find [srv_type]` : finding services by service type.
- `rosservice info <srv_name>` : printing information about the service.
- `rosservice list` : listing the active services.
- `rosservice type <srv_name>` : printing the service type.
